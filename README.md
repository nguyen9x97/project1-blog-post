## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data to better understand:

1. What kinds of homestays are there?
2. Which homestay is the most recommended, house or apartment?
3. What aspects correlate well to the price and how well can we predict it?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@nguyen9x999/how-much-does-it-cost-for-homestays-when-you-use-the-airbnb-service-93673258caa2)
